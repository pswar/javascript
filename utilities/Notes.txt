You have a potentially very-large set of documents, which   are potentially very-large, and contain text. For searching these documents, 
they've been pre-processed into a (very-large) table mapping words to the set of documents that contain each word. 
E.g. (word) : (documents (referenced by ID) containing that word) Apple: 1, 4, 5, 6, 32 Banana: 5, 6, 7, 9, 32 Cantaloupe: 1, 2, 6 ... 
Clients will pass in a set of words (e.g. {apple, cantaloupe}), 
and want the set of document IDs that contain all the words. 
(e.g. {apple, cantaloupe} -> {1, 6}) 
Design a distributed system to implement this, bearing in mind that the number of documents, 
the number of words, and the number of document-IDs-per-word are potentially really, really big.

Consider an X x Y array of 1's and 0s. The X axis   represents "influences" meaning that X influences Y. So, for example, if $array[3,7] is 1 that means that 3 influences 7. An "influencer" is someone who influences every other person, but is not influenced by any other member. Given such an array, write a function to determine whether or not an "influencer" exists in the array.
